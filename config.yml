# env-related settings should go to environments/$env.yml
# all the settings in this file will be loaded at Dancer's startup.

# Your application's name
appname: "myhomepage"

# The default layout to use for your application (located in
# views/layouts/main.tt)

# when the charset is set to UTF-8 Dancer2 will handle for you
# all the magic of encoding and decoding. You should not care
# about unicode within your app when this setting is set (recommended).

# NOTE: All the engine configurations need to be under a single "engines:"
# key.  If you uncomment engine configurations below, make sure to delete
# all "engines:" lines except the first.  Otherwise, only the last
# "engines:" block will take effect.
